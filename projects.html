<p></p><h4>DeepRoute on Chameleon:Experimenting with Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on Chameleon Testbed</h4><p></p>          
            
We developed and test how machine learning and control approaches can be used to optimize how network resources are utilized. The research challenges we target are (1) building real-time machine learning solutions to learn the current network state, (2) use reinforcement and control approaches to optimize how the resources are utilized and finally (3) making the network autonomic to self regulate itself with varying load. Although focused on networks, the techniques developed are relevant for controlling and optimize virtual resources in Cloud management policies. These are an important research area to target, as our current systems are becoming more complex and difficult to manage. These kind of algorithms can help our systems to self-regulate themselves reducing overhead on engineers. During this project, we conduct experiments such as testing various deep learning and data driven machine learning approaches, control parameters and how systems can be robust enough to withstand any given workloads.
            
            
<p></p><h4>Time-series prediction for HPC faults on NERSC </h4><p></p>                                                            

Developed an efficient failure prediction data-driven model using machine learning and conducted an investigation into the trend of the failed components in a high-performance infrastructure.
Studied and developed an effective failure prediction model focusing on high-performance and cloud data centres using data in-production from the National Energy Research Scientific computing centre (NERSC).
Developed a time series model for failure prediction, then test and validate the prediction accuracy of the developed model using data collected for storage, networking and computational machines from the NERSC over a five-year period.

<p></p><h4>Hadoop deployments</h4><p></p> 						                         	       
Configured and deployed Hadoop across Virtual Machines running Linux in the Big data systems and analytics (BDSA) laboratory in the University of Bradford.
Designed and prepared a hands-on lab. materials for the Big data system and analytics course at the University of Bradford where students are able to learn some optimization techniques by designing data models and data pipelines using real life applications data sets. 

<p></p><h4>Analysis of Google dataset Trace Collected from a 12k-Node cluster                                  
(Borg Cluster Management system)</h4><p></p> 							        

Analysed a publicly available Google dataset containing workload and scheduler events emitted by the Borg cluster management system in a cluster of over 12,000 nodes during a one-month period.
Studied how machines in the cluster are managed, and how jobs are scheduled and processed
in the cluster. 
Investigated how the cluster resources are utilized especially, the amount of useful, wasted and idle resources.


<p></p><h4>Network Security Assessment and Evaluation (BradStack)</h4><p></p>                                                    

Conducted a detailed security analysis of the Brad-Stack environment and addressed the discovered vulnerabilities, ensuring the entire infrastructure is secure. 
Conducted a comparative security analysis study of an Enterprise LAN setup in BradStack environment against a physical enterprise LAN setup. Followed by a web application vulnerability assessment as well as a comparison between two existing vulnerability assessment tools against BradStack. 
A comprehensive OpenStack API penetration testing against OpenStack core services was conducted to discover vulnerabilities.


<p></p><h4>BradStack Building OpenStack from ground up</h4><p></p>		                 	       

Deployed a customized OpenStack multi-node installation comprising of the Control, Compute and Network node where each node was configured to have two network interfaces namely the external network and the management network used for connectivity of the nodes. 
Each node was prepared and configured with the following services (Keystone, Glance, Cinder, Nova, Neutron), and several experiments were conducted (Pentest, Wireshark, network analysis using Packet analyser).
Deployed BradStack Cloud infrastructure using the developed OpenStack installation toolkit.

<p></p><h4>BradStack: University’s own Private Cloud Computing facility is Open for Business!</h4><p></p>

<p>The Cloud computing research group at the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science has been successful in developing an in-house cloud computing facility for all to use. Using servers distributed across multiple sites in the department, the group has been able to create their very own cloud which is able to handle various amounts of loads, host software services and encourage game-changing research in building clouds from scratch into fully functional systems. The group has partnered with various organizations, Openstack Foundation, local SMEs and Sardinia Systems, to construct the facility, BradStack</p>
<p>Being led by the visions of Dr Mariam Kiran and Dr Mumtaz Kamala, BradStack provides infrastructure-as-a-service, for managing large pools of storage, compute, manage, and network resources throughout the university. Using open-source software, BradStack is unique and continuously being enhanced by software expertise within the group, making it ideal for infrastructure level research.</p>
<p>Dr Kiran explains “Our vision is that BradStack will be able to create and offer cloud computing services to research students and experimental space for other research groups. Our PhD students are already looking at issues of security, governance, SLAs, fault tolerance and performance analysis; trying out their algorithms on BradStack Cloud. Our initial experiments have shown the BradStack is fully functional and self-sustaining and now we are partnering with the IoT lab efforts to help support them. As a group we pride ourselves in doing core cloud data center research and software engineering, making us unique across the UK. BradStack is now open for business and we invite researchers from across the university to come talk to us about using the facility to host, process and manage their data or software applications.”</p>
